Description: Get currency exchange rates ('EXR') or directly apply currency 
    conversion on a tibble from one to another currency based on spot prices 
    (reference rates) provided by 'ECB Data Portal'. The main purpose of this 
    package is to offer an unlimited and free way to get (potentially approximate) 
    important exchange rates. No API-key required. Data can be requested by periods 
    with days as shortest period. No ask, bid, mid or intra-day data. Unofficial 
    cross-rates based on EUR may be calculated.
